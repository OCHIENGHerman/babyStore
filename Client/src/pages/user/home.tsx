            <p>Pantos (2022) states that marine pollution, especially plastic waste, 
                is a significant problem for coral reefs. Every year, millions of tons of plastics end up in the seas, 
                equivalent to throwing 2,000 garbage trucks full of plastics into the ocean daily (UN Environment Programme 2022). 
                Of these pollutants, microplastics, tiny plastic particles formed from the breakdown of other plastic products, are the most dangerous. Any marine species can consume microplastic particles, resulting in health and reproductive complications (Agbekpornu & Kevudo 2023; Lee et al. 2023).
